# w08_Five_Day_Weather_Dashboard

## Description

This project is part of the Frontend Dev Bootcamp course challenge for the eighth week "Server APIs". 

It requires us to use server APIs such as openweather and third-party APIs like day.js, JQuery and its UI together JScript objects, client-side storage, browser events to build a Weather app. This weather application should allow a user to view the current weather of a city and its five-day forecast. This app should also allow user to check for the weather of any city provided by openweather. 

The JScript and JQuery will produce the output dyanmically to the webpage pages as part of the starter code provided. I've tried to group repeatedly called JScript codes into modular functions where possible.

### NOTE:
 * That for some reason(s) unknown, the text "testing" is actually a valid city according to openweather API. 
   


### Methodology: Pseudo Code

  

### Further Improvements

* Allow search by postcodes/zip code.
* Allow user input predictive typing using a Google Map API
* Render a royalty-free picture (as background image) of the searched city/location



## User Story

AS A traveler

I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities

## Acceptance Criteria

The app should should act as a weather dashboard with form inputs.
* When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
* When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
  * The city name
  * The date
  * An icon representation of weather conditions
  * The temperature
  * The humidity
  * The wind speed
* When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
  * The date
  * An icon representation of weather conditions
  * The temperature
  * The humidity
* When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city
